# Yield curve as an indicator of economic growth

The *trial.py* contains code to render an yield curve using Dash on Python. It contains the following key features:
1. A slider to see different dimensions of the curve.
2. An interactive plot
3. Ability to render the graph on localhost.

## Dash and it's capabilities
Interactive data visualization has an important impact on exploratory data analysis. Before applying any descriptive or predictive algorithm to a dataset we must first understand how the features are related with each other and how they are distributed inside. It is obvious that many visualization libraries provide numerous types of charts that satisfy this requirement. But another obvious thing is that it is a hard job to do the same plotting work for each feature and scroll over each chart to compare findings for each feature.

Plotly is a data analytics and visualization company. Dash is another product of the same company, providing a framework for building web based applications for Python. If you are working with a team or just want share your work with others, a web application is the simplest way, eliminating the library version or interface issues. Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build an interactive web-based application. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface around your Python code in an afternoon.

Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to servers and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.

## Run the code
To render the yield curve yourself, download the code and data file, run the code and render it on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
The chart should look like this:
